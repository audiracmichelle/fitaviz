<p><strong>Fitbit intensity levels from a random sample of minutes and their corresponding step and HR combinations</strong> Fitbit&#39;s proprietary algorithms classify minute activity in four intensity levels: sedentary, light, moderate and active.

Fitbit classification varies among individuals and its intensity levels are personalized. Unfortunately, it is not possible to explain what are the underlying drivers of the classification. </p>
